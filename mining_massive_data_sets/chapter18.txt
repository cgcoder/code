Distance Measure:
----------------
Jaccard similarity is opposite of distance

Euclidean Space:
----------------
Based on location in "space"
Non-euclidean, other measure not on location

d is a distance measure function
1. d(x,y) >= 0
2. d(x,y) = 0 iff x=
3. symmetric, d(x,y) = d(y,x);
4. d(x,y)<=d(x,z)+d(z,y) (triangel inequality)
5. L2norm - usual distance formula
6. L1norm - manhattan distance
7. LrNORM - same as l2, but raised to power r and rth root
8. Jaccard distance (1-jaccard similarity), cosine distance, edit distance, hamming distance

consider:
x={1,2,3,4,5} y={1,3,5}
similarity = 2/5, distance = 1-2/5 = 3/5

edit distance = |x|+|y|-2*LCS(x,y)
